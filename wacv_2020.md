# Interesting WACV2020 papers
> and my superficial opinion -- just one scan


### Metric Learning
* Improved Embeddings with Easy Positive Triplet Mining -- requires a large training mini-batch (large number of positives).
* s-SBIR: Style Augmented Sketch based Image Retrieval 
* Unsupervised Image Style Embeddings for Retrieval and Recognition Tasks -- Facebook Reality Labs
* Stacked Adversarial Network for Zero-Shot Sketch based Image Retrieval 
* Class-Discriminative Feature Embedding For Meta-Learning based Few-Shot Classification -- Metric learning on small datasets (solved in a classification setup)

### GANs
* One-to-one Mapping for Unpaired Image-to-image Translation 

### Attention
* Adapting Grad-CAM for Embedding Networks 
* Attention Flow: End-to-End Joint Attention Estimation -- interesting problem, but poorly written.

### Adversarial 
* Multi-way Encoding for Robustness #spaceEmbedding


### MISC
* Erasing Scene Text with Weak Supervision 
* Evaluation of Image Inpainting for Classification and Retrieval 
* Filter Distillation for Network Compression -- Simple Network compression :hash:industry :hash:Apple
