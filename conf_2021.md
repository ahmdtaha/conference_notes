During noisy pre-training, the network learns a complex features and a complex decision boundary. During the second training stage, SGD stays close to inferior initialization -- it doesn't generalize to test/val splits.

* DualNet: Continual Learning, Fast and Slow `NIPS` `Salesforce` `SG`
	> Propose a continual learning architecture based on Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) theory. CLS states that there are two learning systems: (1) fast in hippocampus, (2) slow in neocortex. the hippocampusâ€™s memories are transferred to the neocortex over time to form a more general representation that supports long-term retention and generalization to new experiences. The proposed architecture has two components: fast and slow subnetworks. The slow subnetwork is trained with a SSL objective (Barlow Twins) using data from episodic memory. Contrary, the fast subnetwork is trained with a fully supervised objective (classification) on online data. The fast subnetwork adapts the features from the slow subnetwork to learn supervised tasks.

The proposal still requires negative samples but not a large mini-batch. The paper operates on the cross-correlation matrix between augmented views inside a mini-batch. The paper is inspired by redundancy-reduction concept from neuroscience, where inputs with highly correlated dimensions (e.g., images) are encoding into independent dimensions.

### ICCV 2021

* Is it Time to Replace CNNs with Transformers for Medical Images? `Workshop`
* DINO: Emerging properties in self-supervised vision transformers. `Facebook` 
	> DINO is a contrastive learning approach but with a distillation loss, instead of contrastive loss. Instead of two siamese network, we have a teacher-student network, where the teacher is a moving average (ensemble) of the student network. To avoid model collapse, the paper utilize centering and softmax. To learn a better representation for KNN, the paper emphasizes the importance of multi-crop augmentation. The paper observe key properties that happens with ViT _only_ with self-supervised learning
	1. Self-supervised ViT features explicitly contain the scene layout and, in particular, object boundaries
	2. Self-supervised ViT features perform particularly well with a basic nearest neighbors classifier (k-NN)

The paper formulates the problem as a min-max optimization. Thus, a special optimizer (e.g., PESG) is required.

* The Intrinsic Dimension of Images and Its Impact on Learning `UMD` `US` `Nice`
	> Natural images has low intrinsic dimensionality (ID). This low dimensionality vital for neural networks learning (faster convergence, better generalization). The extrinsic dimensionality is less relevant for learning/generalization. The paper used an MLE for ID estimation. The key idea is to monitor/measure the scale in number of nearest neighbors as the radius increases. The paper also leveraged GANs to empirically validate the MLE method for ID estimation.
	
* The Deep Bootstrap Framework: Good Online Learners are Good Offline Generalizers `Google` `Harvard`
	> The traditional generalization framework is flawed, i.e., Test-err = Train-err + (Test-err - Train-err). It provides no useful insights if Train-err~=0, i.e., Test-err = Test-err!. This paper propose a new framework for generalization: Test-err = Test-err-online + (Test-err - Test-err-online). In different words, the generalization err = online learning error + Bootstrap error where Bootstrap error denotes the gap between online learning and offline learning. The paper shows that Bootstrap error is generally small for a large range of problems. This makes online learning error an interesting metric to inspect and evaluate. The paper shows that superior architectures in online learning are also superior in offline learning.
