# Interesting ECCV2020 papers
> and my superficial opinion -- just one scan


### Metric Learning
* Hard negative examples are hard, but useful
	> Simple idea -- Selective Contrastive Triplet loss 
* A unifying mutual information view of metric learning: cross-entropy vs. pairwise losses	

### Representation Disentanglement
* Interpretable Neural Network Decoupling
	> Has some good ideas

### Energy-Based Models
* Energy-Based Models for Deep Probabilistic Regression
	> Interesting paper with nice illustration
	
### Self/Un-supervised representation learning
* Memory-augmented Dense Predictive Coding for Video Representation Learning 
	> Technicalities
