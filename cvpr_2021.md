# Interesting CVPR2021 papers
> and my superficial opinion -- just one scan


### Metric Learning
* SLADE: A Self-Training Framework For Distance Metric Learning
	> Self-supervised pretraining beats ImageNet + Sample unlabeled data using similarity distribution loss. lsd :hash:industry :hash:amazon
* knowledge Evolution Neural Networks
	> Mine :) "Classification, Small datasets"
* Unsupervised Discovery of the Long-Tail in Instance Segmentation Using Hierarchical Self-Supervision
	> I should try this hyperbolic embeddings

### Representation Learning / Self/Un-supervised learning
* Jigsaw Clustering for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning
	> Seems like clustering is doing all the heavy work.
* Playable Video Generation -- `PI_arXiv_Ch` 
	> Too many loss terms
* Representation Learning via Global Temporal Alignment and Cycle-Consistency -- `PI_arXiv_Ch` 
	> Differentiable time-warping for videos
	
### Architecture Design
* RepVGG: Making VGG-style ConvNets Great Again -- `PI_arXiv_Ch`


### Misc
* The Affective Growth of Computer Vision
	> Nice reading but worried about the selection bais in informants.
* InverseForm: A Loss Function for Structured Boundary-Aware Segmentation
	> Segmentation
