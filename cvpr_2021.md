# Interesting CVPR2021 papers
> and my superficial opinion -- just one scan

### Metric Learning
* SLADE: A Self-Training Framework For Distance Metric Learning
	> Self-supervised pretraining beats ImageNet + Sample unlabeled data using similarity distribution loss. lsd :hash:industry :hash:amazon

### Representation Learning / Self/Un-supervised learning
* Jigsaw Clustering for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning
	> Seems like clustering is doing all the heavy work.
* Playable Video Generation -- `PI_arXiv_Grp` 
	> Too many loss terms
	
### Misc
* The Affective Growth of Computer Vision
	> Nice reading but worried about the selection bais in informants.
* knowledge Evolution Neural Networks
	> Mine :)
