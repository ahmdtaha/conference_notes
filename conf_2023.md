* Explaining grokking through circuit efficiency `Google` `DeepMind`
	> A neural network comprises multiple circuits that either generalize or memorize. Those memorizing circuits are easier to learn with a small training dataset. Yet, as the dataset size increases, they become less efficient, i.e., needs further updates to memorize newly added points. In contrast, generalizing circuits can easily support new training points without needing any updates. Grokking happens when a network switches from  a memorizing circuit to a generalizing circuit. Since generalizing circuit are harder to learn, it takes long training time (many iterations) for the network to learn the generalize circuit and disable/switch-off (regularize) the memorizing circuits.
