# ICLR
* Avoiding spurious correlations via logit correction
	> Train two models: the first model learns the joint-probability of label and attribute P(y,a), while the second model leverage the first model to reduce the impact of spurious correlations. The paper also uses Mixup augmentation which do most of the heavy lifting (Tab. 3)
