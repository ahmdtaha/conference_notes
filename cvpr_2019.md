> and my superficial opinion -- just one scan

### Unsupervised Learning #unsupervised

* learning to cluster faces on an affinity graph -- unsupervised (Honestly, not sure) formulation for face clustering
* Activity Driven Weakly Supervised Object Detection -- assume a person action, person and human keyboard detection models are available, assumes every action has one and only one object, e.g., drink from cup
* See More, Know More: Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation with Co-Attention Siamese Networks -- I need to read Co-attention papers
