* LASER: Attention with Exponential Transformation `Google` `UAustinTexas`
	> Tweak self-attention so larger gradient get propagated through the model. A simple proposal that works on top of both vanilla and flash attention.

* Triaging mammography with artificial intelligence: an implementation study `Breast Cancer Research and Treatment` `US`
	> Use triaging software to speed-up additional images and diagnostic procedure through a prioritized workflow stream.
	
* Welcome to the Era of Experience `Richard S. Sutton` `Alan` `Turning` `DeepMind` `CA` `GB` `UK`
	> Going beyond Human-supervised AI, into experience-supervsied AI. In the experience era, AI will recieve inputs from many modalities and sensors -- unlike LLMs. The AI models/agents will be supervised using streams of experience -- not input,output pairs. These streams will span long durations of experience, not just short snippets of interaction. These models/agents reward/loss function will come from the environment, not a human defined ground-truth output. These models/agents will plan and reason about the experience, in some latent space and not solely in human terms (language tokens).

* Scaling Language-Free Visual Representation Learning `FAIR` `NYU` `US`
	> Vision contrastive SSL pre-trained models (e.g., DINO) are competitive/superior to vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) at the right data and model scales. Masked Autoencoder methods (e.g., MAE) is competitive as well, but slightly inferior to contrastive SSL models. Web-scale data -- with text content -- boost SSL models in OCR and chart performance tasks. At the right data and model scale, the representation learned by vision only models becomes similar (increasingly aligned) with the representation learned by vision-language models.
	
* Towards Conversational AI for Disease Management `Google` `DeepMind`
	> This google paper optimize on a previous google paper that proposed AIME, Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer. AIME is originally proposed for conversational diagnostic: just talk with a patient to take history and ask question and make a disease diagnosis. Now, this paper extends AIME beyond disease diagnosis to perform disease management: disease progression, therapeutic response, and safe medication prescription. To do so, the paper tackles novel challenges on top of the challenges tackled in the original AIME paper. The original paper tackled challenges in terms of data curation, designing a simulation environment for evaluation and a building an evaluation rubic. This new paper tackled new challenges in terms of medication reasoning, grounding its reasoning in authoritative clinical knowledge. To tackle these challenges, the paper employs the following ideas
	1. Employs an agentic AI system with two LLMs : one for conversation with patient (System 1) and another for reasoning (System 2).
	2. Use in-context retreival to ground reason into authoritative knowledge
	3. Use Coarse Retrieval to avoid encoding all authoritative knowledge (10.5 millions of tokens) which exceeds Geminiâ€™s two million context window
	4. Leverage a chain-of-reasoning as follows:  Plan Response, Generate Response, and Refine Response.
	5. Leverage decoding constraints for structured output generation to make sure that output follows a json schema. The json schema is important for interpretability and traceability or to serve an interface between two components

* AI Agents vs. Agentic AI: A Conceptual Taxonomy, Applications and Challenges `US` `GR` `Cornell`
	> The paper formalizes Agents and Agentic terms in literature. 
	1. AI Agents: These are LLMs with capabilities for external tool use, function calling, and sequential reasoning. These agents perform goal-directed tasks, operate within explicitly defined scopes.

		a.  Agents' challenges: hallucination, prompt brittleness, limited planning ability, and lack of causal understanding.
		b. Agent's three foundational characteristics: autonomy, task-specificity, reactivity-with-adaptation. 
	2. Agentic AI: These are multi-agent systems in which specialized agents collaboratively decompose goals, communicate, and coordinate toward shared objectives.
		a. Agentic's (Higher) challenges: inter-agent misalignment, error propagation, unpredictability of emergent behavior, explainability deficits, and adversarial vulnerabilities.
		
	3. The paper distinguishes between AI Agents and Generative AI (LLMs). Agents = LLMs + additional infrastructure such as memory buffers, tool-calling APIs, reasoning chains to bridge the gap between passive response generation and active task completion. LLMs => AI agents === from content creation to autonomous
utility.

* Has the Deep Neural Network learned the Stochastic Process? An Evaluation Viewpoint `US` `WR`
	> Propose Expected Calibration Error (ECE) as an evlaution metric for DNNs trained on stochastic processes (e.g., forest fire, stock market).

* MediConfusion: Can you trust your AI radiologist? Probing the reliability of multimodal medical foundation models `US` 
	> A new dataset that highlight limitations of medical multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs). Surprisingly, commerical generic MLLM beats medical models on this dataset. The dataset highlights medical MLLMs limitations when presented with nuanced questions -- outside the general medical knowledge domain.
