# Generic

* LASER: Attention with Exponential Transformation `Google` `UAustinTexas`
	> Tweak self-attention so larger gradient get propagated through the model. A simple proposal that works on top of both vanilla and flash attention.

* Triaging mammography with artificial intelligence: an implementation study `Breast Cancer Research and Treatment` `US`
	> Use triaging software to speed-up additional images and diagnostic procedure through a prioritized workflow stream.
	
# ICLR 

* Has the Deep Neural Network learned the Stochastic Process? An Evaluation Viewpoint `US` `WR`
	> Propose Expected Calibration Error (ECE) as an evlaution metric for DNNs trained on stochastic processes (e.g., forest fire, stock market).
