* Uninformed Students: Studentâ€“Teacher Anomaly Detection with Discriminative Latent Embeddings 
> Nice anomaly detection application for feature embedding

* Circle Loss: A Unified Perspective of Pair Similarity Optimization 
> Dynamic similarity weighting (similar to weighting samples hard/easy)

* Hyperbolic Image Embeddings
> Interesting !

### knowledge Distillation
* Regularizing Class-wise Predictions via Self-knowledge Distillation
> Simple and seems to be working

* Revisiting Knowledge Distillation via Label Smoothing Regularization
> A network should never be over-confident about it output

### Unsupervised/Self-supervised Learning

* Large Scale Video Representation Learning via Relational Graph Clustering 

	> Technicalities for large video datasets

* Online Deep Clustering for Unsupervised Representation Learning 	


### Representation Learning
* Self-Supervised Learning of Pretext-Invariant Representations
> Self-Supervised Representation Learning by Rotation Feature Decoupling
> 
> Mathematical notation!

* ClusterFit: Improving Generalization of Visual Representations
