# Interesting CVPR2020 papers
> and my superficial opinion -- just one scan


### Embedding
* Fashion Outfit Complementary Item Retrieval -- lsd, Straight forward supervised setting
* Proxy Anchor Loss for Deep Metric Learning -- Proxy-NCA + Lifted Structuered; converges faster

### knowledge Distillation
* Regularizing Class-wise Predictions via Self-knowledge Distillation
> Simple and seems to be working

* Revisiting Knowledge Distillation via Label Smoothing Regularization
> A network should never be over-confident about it output

### Unsupervised/Self-supervised Learning


### Representation Learning
* Self-Supervised Learning of Pretext-Invariant Representations
> Self-Supervised Representation Learning by Rotation Feature Decoupling
> 
> Mathematical notation!

* ClusterFit: Improving Generalization of Visual Representations 
> Deep Clustering for Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features 


### Misc
* Self2Self With Dropout: Learning Self-Supervised Denoising From Single Image 
	
	> Simple trick to create I/O pairs from single image, use "dropout as bayesian" to minimize variance in output
