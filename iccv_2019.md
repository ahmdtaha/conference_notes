### Retrieval / Space Embedding #retrieval
* Unconstrained Foreground Object Search -- :hash:industry :hash:adobe 

 >looks similar to "Compositing-aware image search", maybe different sampling approach
 
* Personalized Fashion Design
> Interesting way to learn user preference representation


* Ground-to-Aerial Image Geo-Localization With a Hard Exemplar Reweighting Triplet Loss
> Problem is interesting but naive triplet re-weighting. Datasets used CVUSA and  VH.
* Zero-Shot Emotion Recognition via Affective Structural Embedding
* Learning Similarity Conditions Without Explicit Supervision
> Interesting problem but the solution is not convincing
* HowTo100M: Learning a Text-Video Embedding by Watching Hundred Million Narrated Video Clips — **dataset**
