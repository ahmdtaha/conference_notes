# Interesting ICCV2019 papers
> and my superficial opinion -- just one scan

### Retrieval / Space Embedding #retrieval
* Unconstrained Foreground Object Search -- :hash:industry :hash:adobe 

 >looks similar to "Compositing-aware image search", maybe different sampling approach
 
* Personalized Fashion Design
> Interesting way to learn user preference representation


* Ground-to-Aerial Image Geo-Localization With a Hard Exemplar Reweighting Triplet Loss
> Problem is interesting but naive triplet re-weighting. Datasets used CVUSA and  VH.
* Zero-Shot Emotion Recognition via Affective Structural Embedding
* Learning Similarity Conditions Without Explicit Supervision
> Interesting problem but the solution is not convincing
* HowTo100M: Learning a Text-Video Embedding by Watching Hundred Million Narrated Video Clips — **dataset**
* Metric Learning With HORDE: High-Order Regularizer for Deep Embeddings
> Nice paper to review, not sure why contrastive loss outperform triplet loss! The paper uses 256x256 images while other papers uses 227x227 like [Hardness-aware deep metric learning]
* Image Aesthetic Assessment Based on Pairwise Comparison – A Unified Approach to Score Regression, Binary Classification, and Personalization -- **Regression**
* Universal Perturbation Attack Against Image Retrieval

### Self/Un Supervised learning 

* S4L: Self-Supervised Semi-Supervised Learning

> Nice review for Self-Supervised Semi-Supervised learning approaches

* SVD: A Large-Scale Short Video Dataset for Near-Duplicate Video Retrieval **dataset**

### Zero/Few Shot learning 

* Zero-Shot Grounding of Objects from Natural Language Queries -- technicalities

### Attention 
* Understanding Deep Networks via Extremal Perturbations and Smooth Masks 

> Better Reformulating of Interpretable explanations of black boxes by meaningful perturbation

*
