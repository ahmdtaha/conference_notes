* Scalable Pre-training of Large Autoregressive Image Models `Apple`
	> Pre-Training Image models similar to LLMs works. Use Prefix attention and heavy MLPs
* RAD-DINO: Exploring Scalable Medical Image Encoders Beyond Text Supervision `MS` `Med`
	> Vision only pre-training is competitive to Vision-language pre-training. On the importance of masking image modeling and multi-crop during pre-training.
* Vision Mamba: Efficient Visual Representation Learning with Bidirectional State Space Model  `WR` `JRC`
	> Use Mamba instead of vanilla attention. Hugo said it is slow during training. The paper is uploaded to arxiv as work in progress.
