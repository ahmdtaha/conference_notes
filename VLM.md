# VLM Review

## Architecture/Training Objectives

### 1. Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP) by OpenAI [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020)
Trains on image-text pairs crawled from internet.

### 2. A Large-scale ImaGe and Noisy-text embedding (ALIGN) by Google Research [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05918)
Trains on _Noisy_ image-text pairs crawled from internet. 

The _Noisy_ training datasets is the key difference between ALIGN and CLIP.

### 3. Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training (BLIP) by Salesforce [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12086)
Train VLM with three different objectives to support both understanding-based tasks
or generation-based tasks. 

BLIP leverages three training objectives:
1. Image-Text Contrastive (ITC) like CLIP/ALIGN
2. Image-Text Matching (ITM) which is a binary cross-entropy loss to decide whether the text-image pair matches or not. The loss is applied on the [encode] token.
3. Language Modeling (LM) which is an auto-regressive objective -- like typical V/LLM -- that generates the image caption. The caption generation starts after the [decode] token.

### 4. Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training-v2 (BLIP-2) by Salesforce [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12597)
Train VLM with minimal computatinal cost (both frozen vision and LLM). 

The paper trains a Q-former between a frozne vision encoder and an LLMs. The Q-former objective is to bridge the gap between the vision and text representation. To train Q-former, the paper propose a two-stage pipeline: The first stage uses BLIP three-objectives: ITC, ITM, and LM. The first stage objective is to align vision and text represnetations. The second stage is solely a generative language modeling (LM) stage. The second stage objective is to bootstrap vision-to-language generative learning. Q-former contains two transformers that use a shared self-attention layer. The self-attention layer operates on both the learned queries and input text, but leverage different attention-masks depending on the training task (ITC, ITM, ITG).

Key observations: 
1. The Q-former can be regarded as a non-linear projection layer between the vision and text embedding which is a common approach in recent literature when training VLMs. 
2. BLIP-2 propose a two-stage training pipeline which was a new thing in 2023. Nowadays (2025), all VLMs employ a two-stage training pipeline but of course within different training objectives. The current two-stage training pipeline is usually pre-training on a large corpus of unlabeled data, before "fine-tuning" on instruction-following data.

### 4. Contrastive Captioners are Image-Text Foundation Models (CoCa) by Google [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01917)

CoCa is both a contrastive (text-decoder) and generative (multi-modal-decoder) architecture. Two tasks learned simultaneously. Image Encoder + **Text Decoder** trained with contrastive learning. Then, Multi-modal (image+text) **decoder** trained with a captioning task.

### 5. A Jointly-Scaled Multilingual Language-Image Model (PALI) by Google [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06794)

Encoder-Decoder style -- like vanilla Attention Transformer -- that operates on both text and image inputs. PALI is trained using eight different supervision tasks!! This includes OCR, Captioning, VQA, Object Aware VQA, Object detection, etc.

### 6. Flamingo: a Visual Language Model for Few-Shot Learning by Google [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14198)

First clear attempt for VLM models with a single pre-training objective (auto-regressive learning).
This model is trained on all proprietary data.

### 7. ImageBind: One Embedding Space To Bind Them All by Meta [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05665)


While CLIP align image and text pairs, Image-Bind align images with other modalities such as video, depth, audio, etc. In image-bind, the image modality is the central modality that clues all other modalities togethers.

### 8. Visual Instruction Tuning by Microsoft [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08485)

Standard VLM with a projection layer aligning image to text (LLM) space. The paper uses multiple stages for fine-tuning: (1) Learning the projection layer, (2) fine-tuning the projection layer and LLM, (3) [optional] instruction tuning.
